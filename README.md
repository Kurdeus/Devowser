<think>The user is asking me to rewrite the README.md file for their project called "Devowser". Let me analyze the current readme and the project files to understand what a good rewrite would include.

The current README.md has:
1. A brief description of the tool
2. Features list
3. Requirements
4. Installation instructions
5. Usage section (which appears incomplete)

From the other files I can see:
- This is a browser automation tool that uses Selenium to launch Chrome browser instances
- It tries to bypass anti-bot detection
- It has a build process for Windows (build-win.py and build-win.cmd)
- The app.py is the main application file

For a better README, I should:
1. Improve the description to be more informative
2. Ensure the features list is complete
3. Update requirements based on the actual code
4. Complete the usage section
5. Add sections for building the executable since there's a build script
6. Add some other common README sections like "How it works" and "License"

I'll rewrite the README to be more comprehensive while keeping the core information.</think># Devowser

A lightweight, undetectable browser automation tool that launches a Chrome browser instance without triggering anti-bot detection systems. Devowser helps you automate browsing tasks while maintaining a natural browsing profile.

## Features

- Launches a clean Chrome browser instance without detectable automation flags
- Bypasses common anti-bot and automation detection mechanisms
- Runs silently without console window in background
- Provides a seamless browsing experience with realistic user-agent
- Windows compatible with easy executable build process
- Minimalistic and lightweight design

## How It Works

Devowser uses a customized Selenium WebDriver configuration that:
- Disables automation-related flags and signatures
- Uses a realistic user agent string
- Hides console windows and automation indicators
- Manages browser processes to appear like regular browser usage

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Chrome browser installed
- Required Python packages:
  - selenium
  - pywin32
  - pyinstaller (for building executable)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devowser.git
   cd devowser
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the application directly:
```
python app.py
```

This will launch a new Chrome browser window that opens Google by default. The browser will remain open until closed manually.

## Building Executable

You can build a standalone Windows executable using the included build script:

```
python build-win.py
```

Or run the build command directly:
```
build-win.cmd
```

The compiled executable will be created in the `dist` folder.

## Customization

To customize browser behavior, modify the `app.py` file:
- Change the URL on line 39 (`driver.get("https://www.google.com/")`)
- Add additional Chrome options in the options configuration section
- Implement custom browsing logic as needed
